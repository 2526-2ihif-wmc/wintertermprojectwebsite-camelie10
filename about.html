        <h3>About this website</h3>

            Here, I collect and share descriptions and pictures of famous foods from around the world. <br>
            No recipes or complicated instructions, just pure appreciation for dishes that deserve to be seen and
            celebrated.</p>

        <p>This website is for:</p>
        <ul type="square">

            <li>Anyone who enjoys food</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From street food legends to fine dining favorites, <br>every post highlights
            <b>
                what the dish is, where it comes from, why it matters, and what makes it unique.
            </b> <br>
            Think of it like a museum of food, but cozier... and
            tastier.

        <h4>Why I started this site</h4>
        <p>I created this site because I believe food is one of the best ways to discover the world.
            You can learn so much about a culture from what is on its plate and this site is my way of traveling through
            flavor, celebrating iconic dishes, and sharing them with others who
            care just as much.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Now, if you've read this far, I just wanna say: <br>
            <strong>
                Thanks for being here.
            </strong>

        <h3>Pizza</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/mozarella pizza.jpg" alt="pizza">
        <p class="caption">This one is probably the most popular italian dish ever. <br>
            Pizza comes from Naples, Italy, and it became popular worldwide because it's simple and tasty. 
            It starts with fresh dough, tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella and then you can add anything
            from veggies to pepperoni and even seafood. 
            But of course you can also just leave it as the iconic
            Margherita.
        </p>

        <h3>Spaghetti Bolognese</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/spagetti bolognese.webp" alt="spagettia">
        <p class="caption">Another absolute classic from Italian cuisine. <br>
            Spaghetti Bolognese comes from the city of Bologna and became a worldwide favorite because it's rich,
            hearty, and obviously tasty. 
            It's made with spaghetti topped with a slow-cooked meat sauce full of tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs. 
            You can keep it traditional, add veggies, or swap the pasta type — but the classic version is always a
            winner.</p>

        <h3>Tagliatelle</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/tagliatelle.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">Tagliatelle comes from the Emilia-Romagna region and is loved for its perfect balance of
            softness and bite.
            It pairs amazing with creamy sauces, mushroom dishes, or the classic ragù — the wide noodles hold every bit
            of flavor.
            Whether you keep it simple or go all out, tagliatelle always feels like real Italian comfort food.</p>

        <h3>Ravioli</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/ravioli.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">
            An Italian classic that's basically pasta with a surprise inside.
            Ravioli come from Northern Italy and are loved for their soft texture and endless filling options.
            Each little pasta pocket can be stuffed with cheese, spinach, meat, or mushrooms, and they’re usually served
            with tomato sauce, butter and sage, or a creamy sauce.
        </p>

        <h3>Gnocchi</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/gnocchi pesto.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">Gnocchi are small Italian dumplings made mainly from potatoes and flour, giving them a soft
            and slightly chewy texture.
            They originate from Northern Italy and are commonly served with sauces like tomato, pesto, butter and sage,
            or rich cream sauces that coat them well.</p>

        <h3>Risotto</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/risotto.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">Risotto is a traditional Italian rice dish made by slowly cooking short-grain rice in broth
            until it becomes creamy and rich.
            It originates from Northern Italy, especially the Lombardy and Veneto regions.
            Common variations are mushroom risotto and seafood risotto each absorbing flavor deeply due to the rice's
            high starch content.</p>

        <h3>Lasagna</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/lasagne.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">One of my favourites from Italy: Lasagna. <br>
            Lasagna is a layered Italian pasta dish made with wide, flat pasta sheets, a rich meat or
            vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese.
            It originates from the Emilia-Romagna region.
            Traditional versions use ragù (a slow-cooked meat sauce), but variations with spinach, vegetables, or
            different cheeses are also really popular.</p>

        <h3>Bruschetta</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/bruschetta.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">Bruschetta is a traditional Italian appetizer made with grilled bread rubbed with garlic and
            topped with ingredients like fresh tomatoes, olive oil, basil, or cured meats.
            It originates from Central Italy and is popular for its fresh, simple flavors.
            Variations can include toppings such as roasted vegetables, cheeses, or spreads, but the classic tomato
            version remains the most well-known.</p>

        <h3>Salad Caprese</h3>
        <img src="images/italian/salad caprese.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="caption">Caprese salad is a classic Italian dish made with fresh mozzarella, ripe tomatoes, and basil
            leaves, usually drizzled with olive oil and sometimes balsamic vinegar.
            It originates from the island of Capri in Southern Italy.
            The salad highlights simple, high-quality ingredients and is often served as an appetizer or side dish.</p>
